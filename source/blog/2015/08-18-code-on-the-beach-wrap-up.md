On August 9th I had the great privilege and opportunity to speak at [Code on the Beach](https://www.codeonthebeach.com/) about F#. The talk was titled "Currying in a Hurry" because the call for speakers recommended a creative title, and that is the extent of my creativity.

The talk introduces .NET developers to functional programming concepts using F#. The slides for "Currying in a Hurry" can be found [here](http://curryinginahurry.azurewebsites.net/fsharpforthecsharp/output/), and the code samples can be found [here](https://github.com/jeremyabbott/FSharpForTheCSharp). I really hope everyone that attended my session liked it, and that they're looking for opportunities to play with F# at work and/or in their free time.

##Super Awsome People I Met

Everyone I met at Code on the Beach was brilliant and friendly, but a few people stood out:

1. Ricardo Terrell, [@@TRikace](https://twitter.com/TRikace)
  - He gave a killer talk on [Akka.NET with F#](https://github.com/rikace/AkkaActorModel).
2. David Haney, [@@haneycodes](https://twitter.com/haneycodes)
  - [Checkout the slides for his StackOverflow talk](http://www.haneycodes.net/stackoverflow/#/)
  - His blog post ["Developer Turned Manager"](http://www.haneycodes.net/developer-turned-manager/) is a **must read.**
3. Stacey Mulcahy, [@@bitchwhocodes](https://twitter.com/bitchwhocodes)
  - I want her twitter handle.
  - She gave an amazing key note on embracing play. I've been trying to have more fun at work ever since.
  
Thanks for making an introvert in unfamiliar territory feel welcome!
